The summer of my first year M.Sc. student is coming to an end. I have learnt so much during this summer both technical and soft skills by attending
conference, and travelling to Europe. However, I also faced a problems with learning and problem-solving. 

With a limited capacity of my brain and my inconsistent habits, I usually felt overwhelming with the amount of knowledge I need to learn. 
I thought that I knew the topic, but later had to learn its again more carefully. I also forgot a lot. I figured out that I focus too much on declartive learning, 
while focus (too) little on procedural learning. As a result, I cannot retain the new knowledge long enough. 

I am a student researcher, so most of my time also spends on problem-solving. I found myself very disorganized, incoherent, and inefficient in research. 
I usually forgot my initial problem and the main issues are. I often lacked of the ideas how to solve the problems. Instead of solving the problems, I spent (a lot of) time 
on "dancing" around it. Overall, I believe I focused too much on a small details without keeping track the high-level planning. Despite the nature of research, I believe I would be more efficient for a better strategy.

I want to write this blog to refine more effective strategies for learning and problem-solving for future reference. Notice that these are not perfect and universal strategies and these strategies aim toward my ML/RL research. I believe there
are more effective strategies out there and suitable for other cases. Therefore, I will keep updating these strategies based on the scenarios and the result of those scenarios.

# Algorithms for learning
**Remark:** Learning sources can be short-form (papers, blogs, interviews) or long-form (thesis, books)
1. Mentally, you need to be ready to:
   2. Have dirts, but also (some) fun during your learning. 
   3. Be consistent is also very important!
   4. Be suspicious. Don't take anything for granted. Question the statements and symbols. Keep track a list of questions and answer them gradually.
2. (Remember) When you learn, ask yourself these questions after finishing reading
   1. What problems they solved? What are the motivations for the problems?
   2. What techniques they used to solve the problem? 
   3. What are assumptions?
   4. Describe 3 keys ideas in the problems.
6. (Understand/Apply) Come up with examples, intuitions, do practice exercises, re-implement the code to solidify your understanding.
7. (Understand) If possible, teach your new acquired knowledge to a friend/colleagues/lab mates. If not, write a blog and share it with others for feedback. Be as concise as possible.
8. After repeating step 2-3-4, ask yourself these questions
   1. (Analyze) Are there any similar problems? If yes, what are key differences between them?
   2. (Analyze) Are there any similar techniques? If yes, what are key differences between them?
   3. (Analyze) Can we apply current techniques in other scenarios?
   4. (Evaluate) Are there any issues with the current techniques? (Create) If yes, how do you think we can fix it?
8. Reviews your knowledge/notes through active recalls.
9. **Extra**: LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) is your generous friend. Stack overflow, Reddit, Discord servers as well. Take advantage of them, but don't completely
trust them.
10. **Extra**: Write down the problem settings, results and techniques in the universal notebook and 


# Algorithms for problem solving
1. Mentally, you need be ready to:
   2. Be resilient!
   3. Be consistent!
   4. Be careful and mindful. Don't commit yourself too quick into one direction and realize it is wasteful.
1. Repeat to yourself many times these basic questions (Useful to make my thought cohesive)
   1. What is the problem? What are your assumptions/settings?
   2. What are the motivations for your problems?
   3. What is a **simple** example for your problem?
5. Then, ask yourself more advanced questions 
   1. What are similar problems? What are assumptions/settings in those problems? What are exactly similarities and differences between you problems and other problems?
   2. For similar problems, what are current techniques? What are the strengths/weaknesses of those approaches? Can these techniques be used in our problem?
   3. For the current techniques, what are similar techniques? Can these techniques be used in our problems?
5. Narrow down some potential techniques based on previous questions. If there aren't existing potential solution, don't hestitate come up with one. 
2. Design a **simple** experiment to verify your problem and your potential solutions. Keep testing different solutions in this **simple** experiment.
   1. If the potential solution does not work, why does it not work? because of different settings and assumptions?
   2. If the potential solution does work, why does it work?
4. If there is a working solution, ask yourself these questions
   1. Is your current solution working in more complex environment? If not, ask yourself above question?
   2. How good is your current solution compared to other solutions?
   3. Does your current solution have a special condition? If yes, can it be eliminate and generalize?
5. If you are stuck, you can follow the few steps:
   1. Ask colleagues, or generous friend above!
   2. Take a break or do another project, then come back.
3. **Extra**: Keep a notebook for your current project and a notebook for universal information such as problems and techniques. Record information weekly or bi-weekly and review frequently.
