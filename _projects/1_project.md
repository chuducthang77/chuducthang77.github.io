Worked with a team of 4 undegrad, we worked with a wide range of different machine learning algorithms to predict whether patients have large vessel occlusion (LVO) or not. Our current approach is to use SVM with boosting and achieve 83% accuracy on the test dataset. [Code](https://github.com/J-A-T-T/LVO-EEG)
