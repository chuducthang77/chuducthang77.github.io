    Large Vessel Occlusion Prediction
</div>
Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) strokes are a type of ischemic stroke and occur when a major artery in the brain is blocked. With a team of 4 undegraduates, we applied a wide range of machine learning algorithms to predict whether patients have large vessel occlusion (LVO) or not using EEG data. Our current approach is to use SVM with boosting and achieve 83% accuracy on the test dataset.
