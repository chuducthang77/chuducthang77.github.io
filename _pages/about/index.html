Welcome to my personal webpage.</p> <p>I recently graduated from University of Alberta. My primary interest is theoretical Machine Learning. Specifically, my goal is to study the mathematical limits of current machine learning algorithms and to design new ones with theoretical assurances.</p> <p>Moreover, I am recently interested in Online Learning and Reinforcement Learning.</p> <p>Sipping tea or coffee and watching Netflix are my hobby. Studying more about coffee is one of my side projects for this year. Additionally, I enjoy painting and fishing.</p> <p>Finally, I am a huge fan of corgis, especially <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bradythecorgi/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brady and Graffiti</a>.</p> </body></html>
