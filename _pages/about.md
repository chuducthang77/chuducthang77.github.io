Hello world! Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am 1st year M.Sc. student @ [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). I am fortunately supervised by professor [Csaba Szepesvari](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/). I am also a [RL Community Lead](https://sites.google.com/cohere.com/c4ai-community/community-programs/reinforcement-learning) @ [CohereAI](https://cohere.com/)

I am interested in understanding rigorously machine learning algorithms. Specifically, I care about the mathematical limits of current algorithms and want to design new ones with theoretical assurances. I also care about symbolic AI and reasoning.

A current list of my interests:
- Reinforcement Learning theory
- Learning theory
- Online Learning
- (Online) Optimization
- Symbolic AI and reasoning

Sipping tea or coffee and watching Netflix are my hobby. Learning more about coffee is one of my side projects for this year. Additionally, I enjoy painting and fishing.

Finally, I am a huge fan of corgis, especially [Brady and Graffiti](https://www.instagram.com/bradythecorgi/).
