Hello world! Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am 1st year M.Sc. student @ [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). I am fortunately supervised by professor [Csaba Szepesvari](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/) and a member of [RLAI lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/people.html). I used to be a [RL Community Lead](https://sites.google.com/cohere.com/c4ai-community/community-programs/reinforcement-learning) @ [CohereAI](https://cohere.com/)

I am interested in understanding rigorously machine learning algorithms. Specifically, I care about the mathematical limits of current algorithms and want to design new ones with theoretical assurances. 

A current list of my interests:
- Reinforcement Learning theory
- Learning theory
- Online Learning
- (Online) Optimization
- Symbolic AI and reasoning

Non-exhaustive list of hobbies: Brewing tea/coffee, painting and fishing.

I am a huge fan of corgis, especially [Brady and Graffiti](https://www.instagram.com/bradythecorgi/).
